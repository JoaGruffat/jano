# Golf Game Rules: Team Format

## Basic Format
- Two teams of two players each
- Each player plays their own ball
- Team scores are combined for each hole

## Scoring Rules
- **When at least one player makes par or better:**
  - Lower score goes first
  - Example: Scores of 4 and 5 become 45

- **When both players are over par:**
  - Higher score goes first
  - Example: Scores of 5 and 7 become 75

## Examples (Par 4 Hole)
1. **Both players under par:**
   - Player A: 3
   - Player B: 4
   - Team score: 34

2. **One player par, one over par:**
   - Player A: 4
   - Player B: 5
   - Team score: 45

3. **Both players over par:**
   - Player A: 5
   - Player B: 7
   - Team score: 75

## Important Notes
- The team score is always a two-digit number
- The order of the digits depends on the players' scores relative to par
- This format encourages strategic play and team coordination
